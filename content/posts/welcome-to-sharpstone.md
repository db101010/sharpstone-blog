# Welcome to Sharpstone.blog
![Sharpstone Arrowhead Logo](/images/arrowhead-logo.png "center")

Hello and welcome to *Sharpstone.blog*! I’m Randy Haas, an IT professional with almost three decades of experience spanning the full spectrum of technology—from infrastructure to development, information security, and leadership. This site is my platform to share insights, trends, and practical advice at the intersection of technology, leadership, finance, and accounting.

## My Journey
My career began in the trenches of IT infrastructure: designing networks, configuring switches and firewalls, building servers, managing databases, and planning data centers. Over time, I expanded into software development and information security consulting, honing a deep understanding of how systems—and the people who run them—work together. In recent years, I’ve led teams implementing and optimizing enterprise platforms like ServiceNow and Salesforce, blending technical expertise with strategic leadership.

I hold a Master’s in Project Management and a Master’s in Accounting, which complement my IT experience and help me develop a well-rounded, 360-degree understanding of business. Beyond my primary role, I also teach Introduction to Financial Accounting at the college level, where I enjoy helping students grasp the concepts that often drive business decisions.

## What to Expect
On *Sharpstone.blog*, I plan to explore things at the intersection of AI, leadership, and enterprise technology. Ideally I will tie them back to financial drivers of business decisions. My primary focus includes:
- **Artificial Intelligence**: How AI is reshaping IT, leadership, and finance, and what it means for the future.
- **Leadership**: Lessons from managing teams, successful (and failed) IT projects, and how to increase business agility.
- **ServiceNow and Salesforce**: Navigating these platforms and reflections on successful use and key functionality.
- **Finance and Accounting**: Practical insights focused on business strategy and any organization's best asset - their people.
- **Other Tech and Business Trends**: Occasional deep dives into cybersecurity, infrastructure, and market forces shaping the corporate landscape.

 Whether you’re an IT pro, a manager, a finance enthusiast, or just intrigued by our rapidly evolving AI driven world, there’s something here for you.

## Why Sharpstone?
I chose the name Sharpstone for three key reasons. First, it’s inspired by the proverb, “As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another,” a reminder that growth happens through challenge and collaboration. Second, the arrowhead symbolizes precision, strength, and a deep connection to my Potawatomi and Oneida heritage. And third, my training sessions—Arrowhead Trainings—are designed to be sharp, focused, and effective, cutting through the noise to deliver real impact. This blog follows that same philosophy: content that’s insightful, grounded, and purpose-driven.

## Let’s Connect
I’ll be posting regularly, with several articles on AI’s role across these domains coming soon.

Thanks for stopping by. I look forward to our interactions as they will sharpen us both!
