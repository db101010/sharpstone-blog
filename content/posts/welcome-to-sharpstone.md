# Welcome to Sharpstone.blog

Hello and welcome to *Sharpstone.blog*! I’m Randy Haas, an IT professional with almost three decades of experience spanning the full spectrum of technology—from infrastructure to development, information security, and leadership. This site is my platform to share insights, trends, and practical advice at the intersection of technology, leadership, finance, and accounting.

## My Journey
My career began in the trenches of IT infrastructure: designing networks, configuring switches and firewalls, building servers, managing databases, and planning data centers. Over time, I expanded into software development and information security consulting, honing a deep understanding of how systems—and the people who run them—work together. In recent years, I’ve led teams implementing and optimizing enterprise platforms like ServiceNow and Salesforce, blending technical expertise with strategic leadership.

I hold a **Master’s of Project Management** and a **Master’s of Science in Accounting**, which fuel my passion for structured problem-solving and financial clarity. In addition to my main job I also teach *Introduction to Financial Accounting* at the college level, helping students grasp the fundamentals of numbers that drive business decisions.

## What to Expect
On *Sharpstone.blog*, I’ll dive into topics that matter to professionals, leaders, and curious minds alike:
- **Technology**: From infrastructure and cybersecurity to modern platforms like ServiceNow and Salesforce.
- **Leadership**: Lessons from managing teams and driving IT projects to success.
- **Financial Trends**: Insights into economics, markets, and the forces shaping business.
- **Financial Accounting**: Practical explanations and real-world applications.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: How AI is transforming IT, leadership, and finance—and what it means for the future.

Expect a mix of deep dives, practical tips, and forward-looking analysis. Whether you’re an IT pro, a manager, a finance enthusiast, or just intrigued by where AI is taking us, there’s something here for you.

## Why Sharpstone?
I chose the name *Sharpstone* for my consulting company, The Sharpstone Group LLC, for three meaningful reasons. First, it’s inspired by the proverb, “As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another”—a reminder that growth comes through collaboration and challenge. Second, the arrowhead reflects my Potawatomi and Oneida heritage, symbolizing precision, strength, and a connection to my roots. Third, my training sessions, dubbed *Arrowhead Trainings*, are designed to be quick, to-the-point, and effective—delivering impactful insights without fluff. This blog embodies that same ethos: sharp, grounded, and purposeful content.
