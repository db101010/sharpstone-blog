## Introduction

The AI landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Here's your monthly update on whatâ€™s changed, whatâ€™s emerging, and how to make the most of the tools available. I did my original post at https://sharpstone.blog/posts/ai-models-compared/ around 30 days ago and there has been a whirlwind of change since then. I decided that I would leave that post up and offer a monthly summary of new things features, updates and models to watch. The original post has good background - these will just focus on what's new each month. I may then do a deep dive into new features or particularly compelling information as an extra post.

## Updated AI Models

- **ChatGPT**: The big news with ChatGPT is the relase of GPT 4o with native image generation. 
- **Claude AI**: Claude 3.7, Claude Code, real time search capabilties, 
- **Meta AI / LLaMA**: LLama 4 announced
- **Perplexity**: 
- **Grok**: xAI and X merging 
- **DeepSeek**: 
- **Gemini**: 
- **Copilot**: 

## Emerging Synergies

ðŸ‘‰ There are rumnors of Grok and Perplexity creating a puporse built synergy. Groks speed and built in social access plus Perplexities academic rigor and academic prowess could be a big boon for researchers and academics.

## New Models to Watch

- LLama 4 Behomoth is in Preview mode. This could be a powerhouse that will rival GPT 4.5 and Claude 3.7 sonnet due its massive amount of parameters (288 billion active parametes.)
- Claude 4 is on the horizon. Expected to be multimodal with more ethical use features.

## Pairing Suggestions

Often pairing AI models provides deeper, more beneficial results:

ðŸ‘‰ **Academic Research:** Use **Perplexity** (citations) + **Claude AI** (long-form analysis)

ðŸ‘‰ **Business Intelligence:** Use **Grok** (real-time trends) + **Claude AI** (deep analysis)

ðŸ‘‰ **Coding:** Use **ChatGPT** (problem-solving) + **Copilot** (inline suggestions)
